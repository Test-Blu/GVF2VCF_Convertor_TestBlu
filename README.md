# GVF2VCF_Convertor_TestBlu
 Super fast conversion of GVF file format to VCF file format
 
Finding robust variants (predominantly somatic variants) takes some additional resources.

To detect somatic variants, it is preferable to have germline variants known in the studied organism so that germline variants can be removed from the VCF output file of somatic variants.
</br>
These resources can be accessed at NCBI or other relevant databases for human genomes, but for non-human organisms, they are only available in a limited form in some databases.
</br>
Germline variants are only reported in GVF (genome variant format) files for some non-human organisms in the Ensembl database
